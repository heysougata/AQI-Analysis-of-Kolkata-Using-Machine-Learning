# AQI-Analysis-of-Kolkata-Using-Machine-Learning
The primary objective of this research project is to identify the major pollutants significantly influencing the air quality in Kolkata, India. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of historical air quality data and pollutant concentrations, we aim to narrow down the key contributors responsible for deteriorating air quality. Subsequently, we will employ advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the future concentrations of these pollutants. This predictive analysis will enable us to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Kolkata, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to formulate effective air pollution mitigation strategies.
